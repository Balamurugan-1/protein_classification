# Protein Secondary Structure Prediction using BiLSTM

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a **Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)** model designed to predict the secondary structure of proteins. Given a primary amino acid sequence, the model classifies each residue into one of three secondary structure states: **Helix (H)**, **Sheet (E)**, or **Coil (C)**.

The entire workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, is detailed in the `protien.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

## ðŸ§¬ Dataset

The model is trained and validated using the `data.csv` file and tested on the independent `CB513.csv` dataset.

The original 8-state secondary structure assignments from DSSP (`dssp8`) are simplified into a 3-state classification (`dssp3`) for this task. The mapping is as follows:
* **Helix ($H$):** States `H` (Î±-helix), `G` (3-10 helix), `I` (Ï€-helix)
* **Sheet ($E$):** States `E` (extended strand), `B` (isolated Î²-bridge)
* **Coil ($C$):** States `T` (turn), `S` (bend), `-` (loop or irregular)

## ðŸ¤– Model Architecture

The core of this project is a BiLSTM network built with PyTorch. The architecture is composed of three main layers:

1.  **Embedding Layer**: Converts integer-encoded amino acid tokens into dense, low-dimensional vectors. A `padding_idx` is used to handle variable sequence lengths.
2.  **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) Layer**: Processes the sequence of embeddings to capture contextual information from both forward and backward directions. This is crucial for understanding the structural context of each amino acid.
3.  **Linear Layer**: A fully-connected layer that maps the output from the BiLSTM layer to the final three prediction classes (H, E, C).

## ðŸ“Š Performance

The model was trained for 5 epochs on the training dataset. The performance was evaluated on both the validation set and the external CB513 test set.

### **Validation Set Results**
The model achieves an overall **accuracy of 70%** on the validation data.
